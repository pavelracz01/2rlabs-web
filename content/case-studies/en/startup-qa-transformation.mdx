# Startup QA Transformation

A 15-person SaaS startup came to us with a critical problem: every release broke something in production.

## The Challenge

- No formal QA process
- 2 developers doing manual smoke testing before releases
- Customer-reported bugs increasing month over month

## What We Did

1. **Week 1-2:** Audit of existing codebase and release process
2. **Week 3-4:** Defined test strategy and set up Playwright
3. **Month 2:** Built 80% coverage on critical paths
4. **Month 3:** Set up CI/CD integration and trained the team

## Results

- 70% reduction in production bugs
- Release cycle from 2 weeks to weekly
- Team confidence in shipping features increased dramatically
