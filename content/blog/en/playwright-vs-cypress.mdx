# Playwright vs Cypress in 2026

Both Playwright and Cypress are excellent tools. Here's how to choose.

## Playwright

**Strengths:**
- Multi-browser: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Multi-language: TypeScript, Python, Java, C#
- Faster parallel execution
- Better for complex scenarios (file downloads, iframes, multiple tabs)

**Best for:** Teams that need cross-browser coverage or already use Python/Java

## Cypress

**Strengths:**
- Developer-friendly API and time-travel debugging
- Excellent documentation and community
- Built-in automatic waiting
- Great for component testing

**Best for:** JavaScript teams focused on Chrome/Edge, great DX priority

## Our Recommendation

For most modern web projects: **Playwright**. The multi-browser support and speed advantages outweigh Cypress's DX edge for production-grade test suites.
