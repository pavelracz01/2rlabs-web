# Performance Testing Basics

Before you run your first load test, understand what you're measuring.

## Key Metrics

- **Response time** — How long does a request take?
- **Throughput** — How many requests per second can your system handle?
- **Error rate** — What % of requests fail under load?
- **P95/P99 latency** — What's the worst-case for 95% / 99% of users?

## Common Mistakes

1. **Testing in production** — Use a staging environment that mirrors prod
2. **Ignoring think time** — Real users pause between actions
3. **Not warming up** — Cold starts skew results
4. **Testing only the happy path** — Mix read and write operations

## Tools We Use

- **k6** — Modern, scriptable, great for CI/CD
- **Gatling** — JVM-based, detailed reports
- **Locust** — Python-based, easy to customize
