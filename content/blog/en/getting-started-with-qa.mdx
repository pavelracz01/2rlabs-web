# Getting Started with QA in Your Team

Quality assurance is more than just finding bugs — it's about building confidence in your software.

## Why QA Matters

Every release carries risk. Without a structured testing approach, teams find themselves:
- Shipping bugs that should have been caught
- Spending more time on hotfixes than features
- Losing trust with customers

## Your First Steps

### 1. Define what "done" means

Before any testing, establish clear acceptance criteria. A feature isn't complete until it's tested.

### 2. Start with manual testing

Automated tests are powerful, but manual exploration catches what scripts miss. Start here.

### 3. Build a regression suite

As you find bugs and fix them, add tests that verify the fix holds. This is your safety net.

### 4. Automate the repetitive

Once you have a stable manual process, identify what gets tested every sprint — and automate it.
